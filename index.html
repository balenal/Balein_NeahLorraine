    <p>A t-shirt, or tee, is a casual garment with short sleeves and a round neckline, traditionally made from
     light, stretchy, and inexpensive fabric. They evolved from undergarments in the 19th century and became
    popular as general-use clothing in the mid-20th century. </p>

<p>T-shirts are inexpensive to produce and are often part of fast fashion, leading to outsized sales of T-shirts compared to other attire.[1] For example, two billion T-shirts are sold worldwide each year,[2] and the average person in Sweden buys nine T-shirts a year.[3] Production processes vary but can be environmentally intensive and include the environmental impact caused by their materials, such as cotton, which uses large amounts of water and pesticides.</p>
